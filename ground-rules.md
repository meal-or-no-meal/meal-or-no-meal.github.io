# Ground Rules for Meal or No meal

## Communication
Under Normal Circumstances
* Slack will be the primary method of breif communication under normal circumstances
* Google Meets will be used for extended communication under normal circumstances

Under non-normal communication circumstances 
* Texts / phone calls will be used (this can also be used for urgent technical issues as well)

Frequency of communication
* "Green, Yellow, Red" light system where each team member indicates each weekday morning how things are going with their work on the project. Red and Yellow lights will be prioritized in extended team meetings with Reds possibly being addressed sooner.
* Weekly face-to-face 1-hour meetings on Friday afternoons directly after class (typically 3:30, but if we're out from the guest speaker earlier, we will meet directly after we are out from guest speaker)

Task Assignment
* We will be using the free JIRA Project management tool to break down our tasks
* Initial task assignments will be on a voluntary basis
* Prioritization of tasks will be based on what is due by the next Milestone Deliverable for class
* If nobody wants to do a task - we will draw virtual cards with each person being represented by a suit. When someone is selected, they will not be involved in the subsequent card draws until all 4 members have take on additional taks
* Task completion will be coordinated via JIRA

Disagreement Resolution
* If there is a disagreement it will be resolved with a Trial By Stone - where each party gets one swing of a sword at a stone. The person who chips off the biggest portion of the stone will be delcared the winner
* Should no stones or swords be available, we will take disagreements to a team vote 
* If a team vote is insufficient for resolving the disagreement we will bring in an unbiased third party (Nick, Todd, or Rishita for technical issues, Sue for non-technical issues)
